1. read weights, biases => copy in a file 
	1. row major
2. MKL: row-major, dims change
3. MKL code: input-output modify
4. Relu expects float vector: pass vector of floats
5. Softmax input-output
6. library making 

MKL assumptions
MKL: float* (row major): output
input: float* input, weights, biases (row major)

1 . instead of making res in fc_mkl pass a float pointer to be modified (freeing memory)
2. using namespace std isn't a good practice.
3. extern in audioAPI.cpp
4. Added delete[] statements
5. setprecision(6)
